          <p>
            Hello! I’m Prisha, a dedicated web developer with a passion for
            creating innovative digital solutions. With a background in Computer
            Science, I specialize in front-end development and user experience
            design. I am skilled in various technologies including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and I am constantly learning new tools and techniques to
            stay ahead in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey began with a fascination for technology and design,
            leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Over the years,
            I’ve worked on diverse projects ranging from small business websites
            to large-scale applications. My goal is to create engaging and
            user-friendly experiences that not only meet but exceed
            expectations. When I'm not coding, I enjoy photography and exploring
            the outdoors.
